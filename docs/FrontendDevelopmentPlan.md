# Frontend Development Plan for Content Publishing Features

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing frontend components to support the content publishing features described in the WebPlan document. The implementation will connect the React frontend with the Strapi headless CMS to create a complete content management and publishing solution.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: API Services Setup

1. Create a services directory structure:
   ```
   src/
     services/
       api/
         blog.ts
         podcast.ts
         article.ts
         newsletter.ts
         subscriber.ts
         testimonial.ts
       auth/
         auth.ts
   ```

2. Implement API client for each content type with methods for:
   - Fetching lists with pagination and filtering
   - Fetching single items
   - Creating new items (for admin functions)
   - Updating existing items
   - Deleting items

3. Set up authentication for protected routes

### Phase 2: Core UI Components

1. Create reusable UI components:
   - Media players (audio, video)
   - Content cards
   - Forms with validation
   - Pagination controls
   - Search components

2. Implement responsive designs for all screen sizes

### Phase 3: Strapi Integration

1. Create custom hooks for data fetching:
   ```
   src/
     hooks/
       useBlog.ts
       usePodcast.ts
       useArticle.ts
       useNewsletter.ts
       useSubscriber.ts
       useTestimonial.ts
   ```

2. Implement caching strategies for performance optimization

### Phase 4: State Management

1. Set up Redux store with slices for each content type:
   ```
   src/
     store/
       slices/
         blogSlice.ts
         podcastSlice.ts
         articleSlice.ts
         newsletterSlice.ts
         subscriberSlice.ts
         testimonialSlice.ts
   ```

2. Create actions and reducers for data management

### Phase 5: User Features

1. Implement authentication for admin functions
2. Create user profiles for subscribers
3. Set up permission-based access control

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Implement lazy loading for images and media
- Use React.lazy for code splitting
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

### Accessibility

- Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers

### SEO

- Implement meta tags for all content pages
- Add structured data for rich snippets
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Implement canonical URLs

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

## Deployment Strategy

- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement staging environment
- Configure production environment
- Set up monitoring and error tracking

## Next Steps

To begin implementation, we recommend:

1. First, create the API service layer to connect to the Strapi backend
2. Then build the enhanced Blog component as it will serve as a template for other content types
3. Follow with the Podcast player components
4. Finally, implement the email collection and newsletter management features
