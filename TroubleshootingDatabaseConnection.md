# Troubleshooting Database Connection Issues

## Problem Description

The Strapi backend failed to connect to the PostgreSQL database due to a password authentication failure. The error message was:

```
error: password authentication failed for user "baobabstack"
```

## Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue

1.  Verified the database connection details in the `Baobab Stack/.env` file.
2.  Attempted to use the `psql` command to create the database and verify the connection, but the command was not recognized.
3.  Attempted to add the PostgreSQL `bin` directory to the system's PATH, but the changes were not persistent.
4.  Asked the user to manually create the database using pgAdmin.
5.  Asked the user to confirm the password in the `Baobab Stack/.env` file and update the password in pgAdmin accordingly.

## Current Status

The Strapi backend is still failing to connect to the database due to a password authentication failure. The user has been asked to confirm that they have updated the password in pgAdmin to `Nyashaushe@2399`.

## Next Steps

1.  Confirm that the password in pgAdmin is `Nyashaushe@2399`.
2.  If the issue persists, investigate potential network connectivity issues between the Strapi backend and the PostgreSQL database.
3.  If the issue persists, try creating a new PostgreSQL user with the correct password and grant it access to the `Baobab Stack` database.
