# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current Next.js application from using a Strapi backend to becoming a standalone Next.js application. The goal is to remove the dependency on the external Strapi CMS while maintaining all existing functionality through alternative approaches such as static data, local JSON files, or integrated database solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the Strapi backend dependency, so that the application becomes simpler to deploy and maintain as a standalone Next.js app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL NOT require any external Strapi backend services
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL function completely without connecting to Strapi APIs
3. WHEN users access any feature THEN all functionality SHALL work without Strapi dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing content and functionality to remain available, so that the migration doesn't break my experience with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users visit any page THEN all content SHALL display correctly without Strapi
2. WHEN users interact with features THEN all functionality SHALL work as before
3. WHEN content needs to be updated THEN there SHALL be an alternative method to Strapi admin panel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Strapi data sources with appropriate alternatives, so that the application can function independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs blog content THEN it SHALL use static files or local JSON data
2. WHEN the application needs podcast data THEN it SHALL use static files or local JSON data
3. WHEN the application needs testimonial data THEN it SHALL use static files or local JSON data
4. WHEN the application needs user authentication THEN it SHALL use a Next.js compatible auth solution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up all Strapi-related code and dependencies, so that the codebase is simplified and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no Strapi API calls or imports
2. WHEN checking package.json THEN there SHALL be no Strapi-related dependencies
3. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the strapi-backend directory SHALL be removed
4. WHEN running the build process THEN it SHALL complete without Strapi references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have improved performance, so that it loads faster without external API dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL render faster without external API calls
2. WHEN the application builds THEN static content SHALL be optimized for performance
3. WHEN users navigate THEN there SHALL be no loading delays from Strapi API calls
