# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating all static JSON data files and mock API data to a proper database system with blob storage support. The migration will replace the current file-based data storage with a scalable database solution while maintaining API compatibility and adding proper data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all static JSON data migrated to a database, so that the application can scale and persist data properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the configured database
2. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from the database instead of JSON files
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing JSON data SHALL be preserved in the database
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database schemas created for all data types, so that data integrity is maintained and relationships are properly defined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create tables for all data entities (blogs, portfolios, testimonials, podcasts, newsletters, subscribers, comments, contact forms)
2. WHEN creating schemas THEN the system SHALL define proper data types, constraints, and relationships
3. WHEN schemas are created THEN the system SHALL include proper indexing for performance
4. WHEN data is inserted THEN the system SHALL validate against the defined schema

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock API functions replaced with real database operations, so that the application uses persistent storage instead of temporary mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL perform actual CRUD operations on the database
2. WHEN data is created THEN the system SHALL generate proper IDs and timestamps
3. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and relationships
4. WHEN data is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle cascading operations appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file uploads handled through blob storage, so that media files are properly stored and served.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in blob storage
2. WHEN file URLs are needed THEN the system SHALL generate proper access URLs
3. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove them from blob storage
4. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL handle proper content types and caching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a data migration script, so that existing JSON data can be imported into the database without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration script runs THEN the system SHALL read all existing JSON files
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing relationships and references
3. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific database configuration, so that development, staging, and production environments can use different databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific database connections
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate database instance
4. WHEN database credentials change THEN the system SHALL support configuration updates without code changes
